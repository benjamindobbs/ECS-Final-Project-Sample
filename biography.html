        <h1> Karl Marx Wiki </h1>
        <p>
            Karl Heinrich Marx FRSA (German: [ma Åks]; 5 May 1818 to 14 March 1883) was a German philosopher, economist,
            historian, sociologist, political theorist, journalist, critic of political economy, and socialist
            revolutionary. His best-known titles are the 1848 pamphlet The Communist Manifesto and the four-volume Das
            Kapital (1867 to 1883). Marx's political and philosophical thought had enormous influence on subsequent
            intellectual, economic, and political history. His name has been used as an adjective, a noun, and a school
            of social theory. <br>

            Born in Trier, Germany, Marx studied law and philosophy at the universities of Bonn and Berlin. He married
            German theatre critic and political activist Jenny von Westphalen in 1843. Due to his political
            publications, Marx became stateless and lived in exile with his wife and children in London for decades,
            where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German philosopher Friedrich Engels and
            publish his writings, researching in the British Museum Reading Room.
