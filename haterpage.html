        <h1> I literally hate Communism so Much </h1>
        <p>
            Growing up in Rural Alabama I was always taught that the enemy is those good-for-nothing Reds. The soviets
            wanted nothing more than to destroy our beautiful American way of life. Those rat commies just want us to do
            all the hard work and get no reward for it. They want to force us to work and then hand out food rations.
            Well, I will have none of it. The welfare state will be the death of the American Dream. We have nothing to
            gain by following the teachings of the so-called philosopher "Karl Marx".
