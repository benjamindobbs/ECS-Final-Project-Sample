            Uhhh, yeah so basical Karl Marx is really cool. So if you don't know, he wrote this little book, and inside
            that little book are a bunch of words. Well, I can't read, but someone on TikTok told me that it's pretty
            much based. They said that like the proliteriates actually do all the work so like it's really stupid that
            they don't get any of the wealth. I kinda agree with that because I do a bunch of work and I think we should
            share all the money so people don't like, freeze to death if Bufallo or whatever. Anyways, I made my discord
            pfp a photo of a hammer and sickle so you could say I'm down with the class struggle. Go Birds and down with
            the Bourgeoisie!

                Their oppulant spending of the world top earners has devastated the middle class and reduced more people to 3rd world conditions in a 1st world country

                What if we just didn't have homelessness because of a bunch of white dudes in suits inheriting a buisness built entirely off of exploiting natural resources in underdeveloped countries?
